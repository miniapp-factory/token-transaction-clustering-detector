A stylized logo featuring a cluster of interconnected token icons arranged in a circular pattern, with a subtle gradient background that conveys motion and data flow. The central icon is a stylized whale silhouette in blue, surrounded by smaller token icons in varying shades of green and orange, all connected by thin lines to represent network links. The overall design should be clean, modern, and convey the idea of clustering and on‑chain activity.
