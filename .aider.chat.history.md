App Name: Token Transaction Clustering Detector

Description:
Token Transaction Clustering Detector is a Mini App that identifies clusters of token transactions on-chain, revealing patterns of coordinated activity, potential whale movements, or market manipulation. Monitor clusters in real time, analyze wallet behavior, and receive alerts for unusual concentration of activity.

Key Features:
 • Real-time detection of clustered token transactions
 • Alerts for coordinated or suspicious activity
 • Analysis of wallet behavior and transaction patterns
 • Historical charts showing trends in transaction clustering
 • Dashboard to monitor multiple tokens and wallets simultaneously

Use Case:
Ideal for traders, analysts, and on-chain researchers who want to detect coordinated movements, anticipate market reactions, and identify potential manipulation or accumulation patterns.

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the exported `title` and `description` values to match the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a cluster of interconnected token icons arranged in a circular pattern, with a subtle gradient background that conveys motion and data flow. The central icon is a stylized whale silhouette in blue, surrounded by smaller token icons in varying shades of green and orange, all connected by thin lines to represent network links. The overall design should be clean, modern, and convey the idea of clustering and on‑chain activity.
